# Demo Video Script - Face Detection Dashboard

## üé¨ Video Walkthrough Script

### Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hello! I'm presenting the Real-Time Multi-Camera Face Detection Dashboard built for Skylark Labs. This is a comprehensive microservices application that demonstrates real-time face detection across multiple camera streams using modern web technologies."

### Architecture Overview (45 seconds)
"Let me show you the architecture. We have:
- A React frontend with Material-UI for the user interface
- A TypeScript backend API using Hono framework
- A Golang worker service for video processing and face detection
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- WebSocket communication for real-time updates
- Docker containerization for easy deployment"

### Login & Authentication (30 seconds)
"First, let's log in using the test credentials. The system uses JWT authentication with secure password hashing. Notice the clean, responsive login interface built with Material-UI."

### Dashboard Overview (60 seconds)
"Here's the main dashboard. You can see:
- A responsive grid layout of camera tiles
- Real-time connection status indicator
- Recent alerts sidebar
- Add camera button for easy camera management
- Each camera tile shows its current status and controls"

### Camera Management (90 seconds)
"Let me demonstrate the camera management features:
- Click the add button to create a new camera
- Fill in the camera details: name, RTSP URL, and location
- The system validates RTSP URLs to ensure proper format
- We can edit existing cameras by clicking the menu button
- Delete cameras with confirmation
- Toggle camera enabled/disabled status"

### Real-time Features (60 seconds)
"Now let's see the real-time capabilities:
- Click start on a camera to begin processing
- The worker service will connect to the RTSP stream
- Face detection runs automatically using OpenCV and go-face
- Alerts appear in real-time via WebSocket
- Notice the connection status indicator shows WebSocket connectivity"

### Alerts System (45 seconds)
"The alerts system provides:
- Real-time notifications when faces are detected
- Confidence scores for each detection
- Bounding box coordinates
- Timestamp information
- Camera-specific alert filtering
- Pagination for large numbers of alerts"

### Responsive Design (30 seconds)
"Let me show the responsive design:
- The interface adapts to different screen sizes
- Mobile-friendly touch controls
- Optimized layout for tablets and phones
- Consistent user experience across devices"

### Technical Implementation (60 seconds)
"Behind the scenes, the system:
- Processes multiple RTSP streams concurrently
- Uses OpenCV for video frame processing
- Implements face detection with go-face library
- Handles stream failures with exponential backoff
- Maintains real-time performance with frame skipping
- Broadcasts alerts via WebSocket to all connected clients"

### API Demonstration (45 seconds)
"Let me show the API endpoints:
- Authentication endpoints for login/register
- Camera CRUD operations
- Alert management with pagination
- WebSocket endpoint for real-time communication
- Health check endpoints for monitoring"

### Docker & Deployment (30 seconds)
"The entire system is containerized with Docker:
- Each service runs in its own container
- Docker Compose orchestrates all services
- Easy one-command deployment
- Scalable architecture for production"

### Conclusion (30 seconds)
"This project demonstrates a complete implementation of real-time face detection with modern web technologies. The codebase includes comprehensive documentation, testing, and follows best practices for production deployment. Thank you for watching!"
